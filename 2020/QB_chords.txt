    C                                F
I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below

C       G   F    C       G   F

     C                              F
He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo

C       G   F    C       G   F

   C                           F
My heart's in the basement, my weekend's at an all time low

C       G   F    C       G   F

            C                     F
Cause she's hoping to score, so I can't see her letting him go

C                       E                      A
       Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind


         B                       D
She's so swishy in her satin and tat

         B                              D
in her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat

       B
Oh god I could do better than


C       G   F    C       G   F
  That


         C                      F
She's an old-time ambassador at sweet-talking, night-walking games

C       G   F    C       G   F

          C                             F
And she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames

C       G   F    C       G   F

       C                           F
If she says she can do it, she can do it, she don't make false claims

C       G   F    C       G   F

            C                                   F
For she's a queen and such are queens that your laughter gets sucked in their brains

E                          F                            C
    Now she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down

                       F                            E
Yes she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down

                      F                              C
Well could have been me, oh yeah it could have been me

              E                 A
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no


** Chorus **

  C                       F
I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall

C       G   F    C       G   F

        C                          F
And the cot feels so cold that it don't feel like no bed at all

C       G   F    C       G   F

       C                       F
Yeah I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall

C       G   F    C       G   F

         C                           F
And he's down on the street, so I throw both his bags down the hall

E                      F                          C
    And I'm phoning a cab, cause my stomach feels small

                       F                           E
There's a taste in my mouth, and it's no taste at all

                      F                              C
Well could have been me, oh yeah it could have been me

              E                 A
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no


** Chorus **
