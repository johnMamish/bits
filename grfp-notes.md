### Some notes on GRFP essays that I've read.

#### Noemi Glaeser, taken from [Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship).
###### [Research Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MB7I9kXrra8SnTnHpv4B1GdlU3FrgIcP/view)
Sections: Introduction, Background, Proposal, Methods, Conclusion (Intellectual Merit, Broader Impact)

Noemi's proposal begins with an explicit, precise, and technical description of the issue she plans to address. She discusses background details and the current state-of-the-art in research.

Her proposal has a methods section which explictly lists the experiments she plans to carry out, why they're novel, and the impact that she hopes they will have on the state of the art. She discusses specific technical details of her planned experiments.

Her 'Broader Impact' section is limited to technical impact and doesn't touch on societal issues.

###### [Personal statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBjEauCu0KDuoTD6abATkf56Ux5_jTqs/view)
In the first paragraph, Noemi emphasizes her interdisciplinary background. In the second paragraph, Noemi explicitly cites past awards that she's recieved as evidence of her fitness for GRFP.

In paragraphs 3 - 5, she discusses her research experience as an undergrad and at fermilab, briefly summarizing technical points of her research and focusing on quantitative measures of success like authorship and awards.

In paragraphs 6 and 7, she describes her current research and contextualizes it in the frame of her past research, especially highlighting the importance and uniqueness of her interdisciplinary background.

Intellecual Merit: Noemi summarizes her achievements

Broader Impact: Noemi discusses academic-adjacent activites that she's participated in.

Future Goals: Reiteration of research interests; evidence that her research interests are relevant; discussion of future professional plans.

Throughout her personal statement, Noemi makes strong use of boldface to emphasize certain points.

#### Nate Weinman, taken from [Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship).
###### [Research Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjzHrwICVaKbSoAjNOEPkdXKwtdejx65/view)
Sections: Motivation, Preliminary Work, Approach, Research Questions, Resources, Intellectual Merit, Broader Impact

Nate discusses the need for finer grained educational tools in CS so that students' ZPDs can be better targeted, and proposes Parsons Problems as a tool for achieving this. Nate describes his past experience working with Parsons problems, explaining why he thinks they're promising.

Nate essentially bullet-lists 3 major research questions he wants to address: can Parsons Problems effectively teach alogrithmic thinking, can Parsons Problems teach programming idioms, and how can teachers easily incorporate Parsons Problems. For each of these research questions, Nate proposes a hypothesis, rationale for the hypothesis, and a series of experiments for testing the hypothesis.

Throughout his research proposal, Nate makes use of boldface.

Paragraph 1 is a corny intro that I would've cut.

Among paragraphs 2 - 4, Nate devotes one paragraph to each major milestone in his professional life: undergrad research experience, working at Google, and working at AirBnB. In each of these paragraphs, Nate highlights quantiative measures of achievement and discusses how they are relevant to his current research plan.

In paragraphs 5 - 7, Nate discusses his

Nate has a "Leadership Experience" section where he discusses founding and leading an LGBTQ Employee Resource Group at AirBnB and discusses mentoring undergrads. Nate has a "Broader Impact" section where he elaborates on these accomplishments, discussing his efforts / deep involement in making places that he's been more welcoming for LGBTQ individuals.

Rater 1 praised Nate's
  * Good academic record, positive rec letters, and work experience
  * Clarity, framing, and novelty of research plan
  * Leadership experience
  * Practical experience working to eliminate bias towards under-represented minorities
  * Motivation

Rater 1 had no criticisms AFAICT.

Rater 2's comments were confusing and unclear.
Rater 2 praised Nate's
  * Apparent ability to carry out the proposed research
  * Engagement with important topics

Rater 2 criticized Nate's
  * Failure to connect his research plan with potential positive impacts for minorities (Nate does indeed talk about this in the 'broader impacts' section of his research plan, but Nate could've provided a sentence with more direct evidence showing how his proposed research plan would contribute)

Rater 3 praised Nate's
  * Apparent ability to carry out the proposed research (from academic achievement, rec letters, and work experience)
  * Mention of ZPDs
  * plan to achieve some broader impact goals related to minority inclusion through his research (note that this is basically in direct contradiction to rater 2)
  * Diverse set of volunteer experiences

Rater 3 criticized Nate's
  * Lack of a ZPD tracking methodology in his research


#### HaiHao Liu, taken from [Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship).
This application is extraordinarily strong.

###### [Research Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gn68Pn_0P3PllcZwcMZfdhdqiHDVQG2y/view)
HaiHao opens his research proposal by discussing the importance of defects - specifically dislocations - in materials science. He introduces the shortcomings of existing theory in accounting for dislocations and describes his advisor's work with a new quantum field for dislocations - with particles called 'dislons' - as a potentially powerful theoretical tool in understanding and modelling extended defects. Haihao briefly describes past theoretical successes due to dislon theories.

HaiHao lays out 3 explicit research objectives, each of which hinges on applying dislon theory to existing materials science problems. Each research objective has actionable items described in technical terms.

Intellectual Merit: HaiHao claims that his research will allow for application of proven theoretical tools from QFT (quantum field theory) to defect analysis of materials. He includes a paragraph defending this claim.

Broader Impact: HaiHao's research proposal will fundamentally alter the theoretical foundations of defect analysis in materials. This will lead to faster development of materials with desirable properties. HaiHao also has the cop-out answer that "this research will result in things needing to be taught in classes".

###### [Personal Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l1wW0aAkoijjX8_sYzhc4OfikRf-NHb0/view)
HaiHao has done a bunch of volunteer-type stuff in his undergrad that reflects extremely well.

He starts out by broadly outlining his intellectual development, focusing on his long-term passion for theory and materials science and citing the focus on practicality at the expense of theory in most materials science research as a motivating factor. He emphasizes his strong theory background as being potentially disruptive to materials science research.

He has a seperate section that outlines his specific research and academic experience where he explicitly lists achievements and skills (COMSOL, specific research problems, buying EE prototyping equipment, etc).

His broader impact section discusses his international background and social hardship he experienced having moved out of mainland China. He talks about his engagement with an "Alternative Spring Break" group that included a trip to Texas to teach needy kids about science. He discusses his motivation to better educate people about science.

He finishes with a 'future goals' section.
