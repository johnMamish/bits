### Some notes on GRFP essays that I've read.

#### Noemi Glaeser, taken from [Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship).
###### [Research Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MB7I9kXrra8SnTnHpv4B1GdlU3FrgIcP/view)
Sections: Introduction, Background, Proposal, Methods, Conclusion (Intellectual Merit, Broader Impact)

Noemi's proposal begins with an explicit, precise, and technical description of the issue she plans to address. She discusses background details and the current state-of-the-art in research.

Her proposal has a methods section which explictly lists the experiments she plans to carry out, why they're novel, and the impact that she hopes they will have on the state of the art. She discusses specific technical details of her planned experiments.

Her 'Broader Impact' section is limited to technical impact and doesn't touch on societal issues.

###### [Personal statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBjEauCu0KDuoTD6abATkf56Ux5_jTqs/view)
In the first paragraph, Noemi emphasizes her interdisciplinary background. In the second paragraph, Noemi explicitly cites past awards that she's recieved as evidence of her fitness for GRFP.

In paragraphs 3 - 5, she discusses her research experience as an undergrad and at fermilab, briefly summarizing technical points of her research and focusing on quantitative measures of success like authorship and awards.

In paragraphs 6 and 7, she describes her current research and contextualizes it in the frame of her past research, especially highlighting the importance and uniqueness of her interdisciplinary background.

Intellecual Merit: Noemi summarizes her achievements

Broader Impact: Noemi discusses academic-adjacent activites that she's participated in.

Future Goals: Reiteration of research interests; evidence that her research interests are relevant; discussion of future professional plans.

Throughout her personal statement, Noemi makes strong use of boldface to emphasize certain points.

###### [Research Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjzHrwICVaKbSoAjNOEPkdXKwtdejx65/view)
Sections: Motivation, Preliminary Work, Approach, Research Questions, Resources, Intellectual Merit, Broader Impact

Nate discusses the need for finer grained educational tools in CS so that students' ZPDs can be better targeted, and proposes Parsons Problems as a tool for achieving this. Nate describes his past experience working with Parsons problems, explaining why he thinks they're promising.

Nate essentially bullet-lists 3 major research questions he wants to address: can Parsons Problems effectively teach alogrithmic thinking, can Parsons Problems teach programming idioms, and how can teachers easily incorporate Parsons Problems. For each of these research questions, Nate proposes a hypothesis, rationale for the hypothesis, and a series of experiments for testing the hypothesis.

Throughout his research proposal, Nate makes use of boldface.

Paragraph 1 is a corny intro that I would've cut.

Among paragraphs 2 - 4, Nate devotes one paragraph to each major milestone in his professional life: undergrad research experience, working at Google, and working at AirBnB. In each of these paragraphs, Nate highlights quantiative measures of achievement and discusses how they are relevant to his current research plan.

In paragraphs 5 - 7, Nate discusses his

Nate has a "Leadership Experience" section where he discusses founding and leading an LGBTQ Employee Resource Group at AirBnB and discusses mentoring undergrads. Nate has a "Broader Impact" section where he elaborates on these accomplishments, discussing his efforts / deep involement in making places that he's been more welcoming for LGBTQ individuals.
